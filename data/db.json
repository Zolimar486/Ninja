      "body": "Crude oil includes lease condensate. The sum of individual states may not equal total U.S. volumes due to independent rounding. Volumes are rounded to the nearest whole number; a zero may indicate volume of less than 0.5 thousand barrels per day. Previous months' production volumes may have been revised for all states/areas. Percent change is calculated using unrounded values.",
